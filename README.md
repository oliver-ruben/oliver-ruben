## About

I am a telecommunications engineer with over a decade of deep, hands-on experience in VoIP, SIP signaling, and real-time media streaming. My background includes designing, building, and maintaining reliable, high-performance communication systems for service providers and enterprise clients. 

My primary technical focus is on SIP server engineering, large-scale WebRTC deployments, media proxying, and building resilient, secure, and scalable platforms for real-time voice and video services. I am passionate about open source, protocol analysis, and robust system architecture.

**Areas of expertise:**

- SIP server development and operations (Freeswitch, Kamailio, OpenSIPS, Asterisk)
- WebRTC signaling and media path, including TURN/STUN, ICE, RTP/SRTP
- Large-scale system design: high-availability, failover, load balancing, clustering
- Security best practices for VoIP, including encryption, anti-fraud, and abuse mitigation
- Monitoring and troubleshooting (Homer SIP Capture, Prometheus, Grafana)
- Automation and deployment (Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Scripting and backend integrations (Python, Bash, Node.js, C/C++)
